Repair It is a hyper-local, "Blinkit-style" on-demand repair platform. It connects users instantly with local technicians and specialized repair hubs. The app categorizes services into two main flows:
Express Pickup: For small electronics and garments, a runner arrives in minutes to take the item to a hub.
On-Site Service: For heavy appliances and automotive needs, a specialist is dispatched directly to the user's location.
The interface features real-time AI-powered diagnosis via a live map of nearby experts, and a high-speed "instant-fix" aesthetic inspired by modern quick-commerce apps.
#This is what our goal for this app.
